Hello there.

My name is Peter, I have studied mathematics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and work as an agile full-stack software developer.
In addition to my technological affinity, I have a longstanding passion for making, hearing and analyzing music.

In this blog, I am going to write about anything that comes to my mind. Let's see what happens.
